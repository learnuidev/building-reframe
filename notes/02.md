## `reg-event-db` and `dispatch`

So far, we have learned that re-frame uses reagent atom as its application db. Now lets talk about writing to this app-db.

Re-frame is an event driven state management framework. In re-frame, we dont directly update reagent atom. Instead we have to first register an event handler. Event handler can be registered using `reg-event-db` function.

This function takes an `event-id`, a keyword, and a handler function. This handler function accepts `db` value as the first argument and event vector as the second.

Internally, re-frame stores this function in an atom called `kind->id->handler`. Lets create a file called registrar and add this atom

```clj
(ns app.registrar)

(def kind->id->handler  (atom {}))
```

Now that we have defined kind->id->handler, we can use this inside `reg-event-db`.

Let's create another file called `re_frame.cljs` and import kind->id->handler. We will use this atom inside `reg-event-db`

```clj
(ns app.re-frame
  (:require [app.registrar :refer [kind->id->handler]]))

(defn reg-event-db [event-id handler]
  (swap! kind->id->handler assoc-in [:event event-id] handler))

```

Now that `reg-event-db` is implemented. Lets register our first event by implementing classic counter application

```clj
(ns app.core
  (:require [reagent.core :as r]
            [app.re-frame :as rf]
            [reagent.dom :as rdom]))

;;
(rf/reg-event-db
 :init
 (fn [db _]
   {:counter 0}))

;;
(rf/reg-event-db
 :increment
 (fn [db _]
   (update db :counter inc)))

```

If you inspect `kind->id->handler` using REPL, there should be two event handlers registered

```clj
(comment
  @kind->id->handler)

-> {:event {:init #object[Function] (function), :increment #object[Function] (function)}}
```

Now that we have implemented `reg-event-db` function, next lets look at how we can use these handlers
