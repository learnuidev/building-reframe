## `dispatch` function

In the last section, we look at `reg-event-db` v1 function, which takes an event id and an handler function and saves the function inside an atom.
In this section we are going to look at `dispatch` function


First let's implement a naive version of dispatch. This function will take event vector as an argument. It will then check if the event is infact registed. If it is registed then it will invoke the function and updated the app-db. Otherwise throw a warning saying event handler is not registered


```clj
(defn dispatch [event]
  (let [event-id (first event)]  ;; (1)
    (if-let [handler (get-in @kind->id->handler [:event event-id])] ;; (2)
      (let [updated-db (handler @app-db event) ;; (3)
            _ (reset! app-db updated-db)] ;; (4)  
        event) ;; (5)
      (js/console.warn (str "No event handler registered for " event-id))))) ;; (6)

```

1. First we extract event-id from event vector
2. Second, we check if the event handler has been registered
3. Third, we call the handler function passing the app-db as well as the event vector. The value returned is the new database value
4. Fourth, we update app-db with this new database value
5. Finally we return the event vector
6. If the handler is not found, then we simply call console.warn saying no handler is registered for the event

Now time to test it using REPL

```
(comment
  (dispatch [:init])
  (dispatch [:increment])
  (dispatch [:na])
  @app-db)

=> {:counter 1}
```

Now that our dispatch function is working, lets move on to reading value from the app-db. In the next lesson we are going to look at subscriptions
